## Title of the research project:
## An Evaluation of Nature-inspired Optimization Algorithms and Machine Learning Classifiers for Electricity Fraud Prediction

This study evaluated an algorithm level approach based on nature-inspired optimization algorithms which are Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) to address imbalanced class problem. The method involves adaptively balancing the distribution (undersample the majority class) and combine with supervised machine learning classifiers which are Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient-Boosted Tree (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) to enhance the classification performance for electricity fraud prediction. 

Comparison between Random Undersamping, PSO & GWO techniques in undersampling the majority class and comparison between classifiers with imbalanced and balanced dataset from the above techniques.
